Using CockroachDB as part of a Ruby on Rails app is easy. Cockroach Labs maintains the [ActiveRecord Adapter Gem](https://github.com/cockroachdb/activerecord-cockroachdb-adapter), a direct extension of the PostgreSQL adapter. This makes it very straightforward to switch from a default option to CockroachDB. The full instructions are available via [https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/how-to-a-complete-web-app-with-rails-and-cockroachdb/](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/how-to-a-complete-web-app-with-rails-and-cockroachdb/).
